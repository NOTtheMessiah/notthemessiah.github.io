            <h1>About</h1>

            <p>Brian is a <strong>software developer</strong> with an background in <strong>Physics</strong>, and has academic interests in neural networks, economic theory, formal logic, and statistical mechanics.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a traditional CV/Resume, <a href="./contact.html">send me an email</a>.</p>
<h2 id="data-analysis">Data Analysis</h2>
<p>Past work has mostly used traditional/frequentist <strong>statistical analysis</strong> in coursework and internships, but I have kept up with Bayesian statistics and Machine Learning techniques.</p>
<p>I have been dabbling with <strong>neural networks</strong>, contributing examples to new deep-learning frameworks, though my work at this time is stalled due to lack of hardware.</p>
<h2 id="digital-design">Digital Design</h2>
<p>I consider myself competent at <strong>web design</strong>, most recently doing work for <a href="https://symbiotica.io">Symbiotica Kombucha</a>, including the logo. I have also done volunteer and hobbyist level <strong>graphic</strong> and web <strong>design</strong>.</p>
<p>As someone whose blood runs on <strong>Linux</strong>, I tend to customize my environment for workflow and personality. I have designed color palettes and the tools to generate them using perceptual color spaces for use with web design, graphical toolkit themes, and terminal color themes. As for my desktop environment, I use <em>xmonad</em>.</p>
<h2 id="software-engineering">Software Engineering</h2>
<p>Past work has been in <strong>scientific computing</strong> (data crunching and physical simulation), mostly using Python but more recently Julia, including automated web testing of <a href="https://shashi.github.io/Escher.jl/">Escher.jl</a> a Functional Reactive Framework for the technical computing language <a href="http://julialang.org/">Julia</a>.</p>
<p>Additional public hobby-level work is available on my <a href="https://github.com/notthemessiah">Github</a>.</p>
<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<h4 id="read-only">Read-Only</h4>
<p>Most recently, my primary research interest has been in economic theory, taking a critical approach towards the assumptions and axioms. This also includes the philosophical and historical context of these theories. This comes after delving into mathematical philosophy (consecutively) following interests in formal logic, PL (Programming Language) theory, and stastical mechanics.</p>
<p>Other tangential research interests include quantum physics, and history of science.</p>
<h4 id="readwrite">Read/Write</h4>
<p>I also teach for pleasure and for profit. From private <strong>tutoring</strong> in all areas of mathematics, I take a <em>intuitionist</em> approach a la <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._E._J._Brouwer">Brouwer</a> building from what the student already knows via analogies, developing a context, and then following on how to approache the problem with systems-thinking.</p>
<p>I have also <strong>lecture</strong>d at volunteer events, from CryptoParties to Maker-events, also as an instructor for technical skills such as soldering.</p>
<p>I have been considering using <a href="http://explorableexplanations.com/">Explorable Explanations</a> for the use in education as it offers much more feedback in the learning process, but have not the venue to explore the use of this technique.</p>
